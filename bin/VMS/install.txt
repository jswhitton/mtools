Installation notes for Mtools
-----------------------------

The VMS files are supplied as a VMS backup saveset MTOOLS.BCK
They can be unpacked using the standard VMS backup utility:
  $ BACKUP MTOOLS.BCK/SAVE []/LOG

- note that it is necessary to ensure that the file is a fixed-record
file with record size 32256, as required by backup. If the file is
to be installed via pc running pathworks, use something like
  c:\> NFT COPY/IMAGE/FIX/MRS:32256 mtools.bck node::mtools.bck

If it is being transferred using kermit in binary mode, it will be
necessary to modify the record size:
  $ set file mtools.bck /attribute=(fix,mrs:32256)


The Mtools suite can be installed either system-wide by the
system manager, but can be setup on a per-process basis without
the need for any privileges.

------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The following logical names are required. They can be defined
  per-process, or system wide   (  $ DEFINE [/SYSTEM] )

 MTL_CMDS  is a logical pointing at the directory containing the
           executables

 MTL_MID   is the full filename (including path) for a file in
           which the mtools maintain the current SCI message ID
           between runs. Authorised users of the mtools require
           read/write access to this file. (The tools ought to work
           without a file to save the message id, but this use is
           not supported.)

 MTL_PORT  is the host port to which the SCI is attached. The host
           driver should be configured using SET TERM [/PERMANENT]
           as below...

           The most important attributes are
           /NOECHO   - so that SCI replies are not bounced back as requests
           /EIGHT    - required if 8-bit characters are used in RS3 files
           /NOESCAPE - to inhibit validation of escape sequences
           /NOBROAD  - to prevent VMS sending broadcast messages
           /TTSYNC/HOSTSYNC  - if SCI is configured for flow control
           /PASSALL /PASTHRU - to prevent VMS from formatting messages.
           /ALTYPEAHD- to increase the read-ahead buffer

            If these are not the /permanent settings, it is
           necessary to ALLOC the terminal then SET TERM as appropriate

   VMS Style Input


2) Optional logical names or symbols. These can be defined system-wide
 and/or over-ridden per-process

  MTL_STFR  is the string used to start a reply from the SCI. The
           string must not contain any control characters. The
           default is "("

  MTL_ENDFR  is the string used to end replies from the SCI. The string
            should not contain any control characters, though the SCI
            must be configured to also send a control character as part
            of the reply. The default is ")"

  MTL_CHKSM  is "Y" or "N", depending on whether all communication
           with the SCI is to be verified using checksums. The default
           is "Y"



3) The commands must be defined as verbs, using $ SET COMMAND MTOOLS
  This can be done per process, or system-wide using
  $ SET COMMAND/TABLE=SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE -
     /OUTPUT=SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE MTOOLS


4) (Optional)  The online help text can be added to a system-wide
   or local VMS help dictionary. It can be added to the main system
  help with

$ LIBRARY SYS$HELP:HELPLIB/HELP MTOOLS

 or to a local help library, which can be added to the help search
 path by defining HLP$LIBRARY_n in the usual way.




5)  (Optional) Because of VMS/DCL limitations, the verbs must be
  unique to 4 characters, so that the names MGETASC etc cannot
  be used as verbs. They are defined instead as the verbs MGASC,
  MPASC, etc, and if required, symbols can be set up as aliases:

 $ mgetasc :== mgasc
 $ mputasc :== mpasc

 etc - this should be done in sylogin.com, login.com, or perhaps
 in mtl_cmds:setup.com, depending on local preferences.
